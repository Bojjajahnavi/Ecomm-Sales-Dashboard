ECOMM Sales Dashboard


This Power BI dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of ecommerce sales data. It includes a variety of visualizations that track key metrics such as profit, sales, quantity, shipping cost and sales revenue by category, state, country, market and ship mode. The dashboard also allows users to drill down into the data to see more detailed information about specific products, customers or time periods.



## Business Problem

Many e-commerce businesses struggle to gain actionable insights from their sprawling sales data. Buried beneath spreadsheets and raw numbers, valuable trends and correlations often remain overlooked. This lack of clear visibility can lead to missed opportunities, ineffective marketing campaigns, and ultimately, lost revenue.
